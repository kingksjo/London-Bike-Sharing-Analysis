# London Bike Sharing Analysis & Dashboard (First Tableau Dashboard!)

This repository showcases my analysis of the London Bike Sharing dataset from Kaggle, culminating in a visually informative dashboard created in Tableau. This project marks my first foray into creating dashboards with Tableau.

**Project Overview**

Dataset: London Bike Sharing dataset from Kaggle
Analysis Tools: Python (pandas)
Visualization Tool: Tableau
Analysis Conducted

I explored trends in the London Bike Sharing dataset, focusing on the following aspects:

Total number of bike rides
Moving average of bike rides over a selected time period
Relationship between temperature and wind speed
Weather conditions influencing ridership
Tableau Dashboard

The created dashboard provides an interactive view of these key metrics:

Top Left: Displays the total number of bike rides.

Line Graph: Shows the moving average of bike rides over time.

Hover Tooltips: Reveal bar charts detailing weather conditions associated with specific points on the line graph and heatmap.

Bottom Section: Displays a heatmap depicting the relationship between temperature and wind speed.
